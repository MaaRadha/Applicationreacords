# ApplicationRecordDb API

Welcome to the **ApplicationRecordDb API**! This is an **ASP.NET Core Web API** designed to help you track your job applications. Whether you're applying to multiple companies or simply keeping track of your progress, this API provides a structured way to record your applications, associated contacts, and personal notes.

## Why I Built This API

I built the **ApplicationRecordDb API** because I found myself losing track of where I applied for jobs, who I spoke with, and what the status of my applications was. Sometimes, we forget which job we applied to, which company it was, or who we need to follow up with. This API is my personal solution to help me stay organized and keep all that information in one place.

## API Documentation

This project uses **Swagger** to generate interactive API documentation.

## Features

- Record Application Contacts
- Add and View Personal Notes for Each Application
